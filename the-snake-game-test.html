It’s an interesting framework to help you ensure you don’t waste time learning unnecessary things.</p><p>The Snake-Game Test was inspired by me when I was trying to build a snake game using C++.</p><p>When I was building the game, I didn't learn the entire C++ language constructs, but I only learned what I needed to build the snake game.</p><p>That approach gave me a better understanding of basic game design, and basic C++ constructs. I always know if I want to learn more advanced C++ features, then I can learn it by building even more complex programs.</p><p>Here are the 4 foundational concepts of The Snake-Game Test:</p><ol><li>Real-World Project</li><li>Just-In-Time learning</li><li>Extremely Hands-On</li><li>Iteratively Improve the Project</li></ol><p>Let's dive right into each concept.</p><h1>Real-World Project</h1><p>If what you do is hypothetical projects like foobar, building linked list, etc. You'll struggle to apply the topic you're learning.</p><p>Instead, pick a real-world project, that's concrete enough for you to work on, like the Snake game. Everyone has played snake game at some point in their life.</p><p>Instead of writing program with 1000 linked-list, why not create a snake-game <em><strong>that applies linked-list concept to the snake?</strong></em></p><h1>Just-In-Time Learning</h1><p>Instead of learning everything upfront (which takes too much time), The Snake-Game Framework encourages you to learn just enough to make the project work.</p><p>Instead of learning every C++ feature from a book, learn just enough to make the snake move. Start by asking questions:</p><ul><li>Snake usually moves in grid, how to implement grid system in C++?</li><li>How do I actually <em>draw</em> image using C++?</li><li>How to make the snake move? What data structure to use?</li><li>How to place snake's food at random places?</li><li>How to detect the snake biting itself?</li><li>Etc.</li></ul><p>By answering the questions above, you are guaranteed to learn and use only the important things of C++ for the snake game.</p><p>Another example, let's say you want to learn MQTT and decide to build a temperature monitoring system. You don't read the source code of HiveMQ Broker. Instead, you ask these questions:</p><ul><li>What is MQTT? How can I send data from A to B?</li><li>What is MQTT Topic? What is QoS? What's the difference?</li><li>Should I write my own client or is there ready-to-use library for MQTT?</li><li>etc.</li></ul><p>That way, you won't overwhelm yourself with the complexity of MQTT broker source code. You will have good experience and great understanding of the basics.</p><h1>Extremely Hands-On</h1><p>We're not doing theoretical study here.</p><p>We're not analyzing the game design mechanics, reward system, level-up mechanism, etc. We want to build the damn snake-eating-food game until it dies.</p><p>We're not writing an essay on how MQTT actually sends and transmits data.</p><p>We're not writing an essay comparing MQTT vs. HTTP vs. WebSocket.</p><p>We're building something. Period.</p><p>Yes, you might have to research a bit, but the goal is to assist you in building the project, not writing essay.</p><h1>Iterative Approach</h1><p>The Snake-Game Framework encourages iterative process.</p><p>First, you make the program draw grid. No snake yet? No problem.</p><p>Second, you make the program render the snake. No foods yet? No problem.</p><p>Third, you make the snake move and add food. Buggy? Good. Fix it.</p><p>Next, you start adding wall detection, self-bite detection, etc.</p><p>The point is, nobody is watching you, so you might want to make as many stupid mistakes as humanly possible (you will be surprised how many recompilations I did just to fix a simple bug).</p><p>This Snake-Game Test (probably I should call it "framework") will <strong>help you close the gap between what you know vs. what you can do</strong>.</p><p>Happy learning! 🐍</p><p></p><p class="msg msg--info" data-slate-node="element">Whenever you're ready, there are 2 ways I can help you:<br><br>1. <a href="https://freelancer.rosmianto.com/">Becoming Embedded Freelancer Book</a>.
