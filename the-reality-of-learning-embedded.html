Familiar with Arduino. Nothing more.</li><li>Veteran. You are battle-tested, lots of technical scars embedded (nice pun!) in your face.</li></ol><p>Group #1, enjoying their craft with Arduino, but not realizing that there are a whole world beyond Arduino.</p><p>Group #2, too busy even to guide #1. They are in high demand, and they seemed to be always working on something.</p><p>If I draw those two groups, maybe it looked like this:</p><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://rosmianto.com/media/posts/3/Untitled.png" alt="" width="3494" height="1000" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" srcset="https://rosmianto.com/media/posts/3/responsive/Untitled-xs.png 300w, https://rosmianto.com/media/posts/3/responsive/Untitled-sm.png 480w, https://rosmianto.com/media/posts/3/responsive/Untitled-md.png 768w, https://rosmianto.com/media/posts/3/responsive/Untitled-xl.png 1200w"></figure><p>They live in a different island. They have different activity and rules.</p><p>Me myself, just stranded to the veteran island, so I know how it feels to live in both islands.</p><p>The problem is, I got there by swimming, forcing myself to move the hard way. But something I know for sure is swimming isn't for everybody.</p><p>Being a noob is both easy and difficult:</p><ul><li>Easy because you have lots of tutorials for beginner</li><li>Difficult because you have lots of tutorials for beginner</li></ul><p>You see the irony? Tutorials have been a blessing and a curse.</p><h2>The Issue With Tutorials</h2><p>I'm pretty sure you have followed a tutorial at some point in your embedded career. What you usually find?</p><p>Prepare the breadboard üëâ follow the wiring connection üëâ copy the example code üëâ build and flash. Voila!</p><p>Yes, there's some explanations (like Adafruit and Sparkfun tutorials, they're great!), but the nature of tutorial is to <em>guide you do something really specific </em>(like blinking LEDs or reading sensor), nothing more.</p><p>Problem arise when you want to level up your game. You might search for more advanced tutorials, like "how to use FreeRTOS", and fortunately you can get that tutorial.</p><p>You then search for even more advanced topic like "how to set correct FreeRTOS priority values", no tutorials.</p><p>You search "how to make performant multiple FreeRTOS tasks", you ended up with multiple sources, a bit here, a bit there. There's no single tutorials that explains all.</p><p>Yes, that's the reality when you leave that noob island.</p><p>You need to understand multiple concepts at once to understand FreeRTOS priority values.</p><p>You need to understand multiple concepts at once to make performant FreeRTOS tasks.</p><p>It's like Googling "how to build website like Facebook" and gets frustrated.</p><p>Building Facebook isn't a tutorial bruh.</p><h2>Noob Island Inhabitants</h2><p>They don't have tutorials for advanced topics so they do what they can. They make sub-par work, even though they use many advanced concepts. I've seen it with my own eye!</p><p>For example, I've seen a junior engineer wanted to run multiple tasks in parallel using ESP32. Instead of using the good ol' FreeRTOS tasks, he used some random library on the internet, acting as a scheduler, and throw code into the scheduler.</p><p>Well, to be fair, the code is working btw.</p><p>BUT IT STUTTERS, LIKE A LOT!</p><p>He wasn't aware that ESP32 has multiple core, and he wasn't even aware the framework provides xTaskCreate() to make tasks.</p><h2>I Want to Help</h2><p>There are definitely issues there, and instead of swimming by themselves to veteran island. I want to build a small ship to help noob island inhabitants cross the sea, and land safely at the veteran island.</p><p>I know, it's just a small dream, but I believe noob island inhabitants also deserve a better experience, better network, better friends, that they can find in veteran island. I believe I have to build a transportation mode, a ship if you want to call it, to help people cross the sea.</p><h2>My Small Ship</h2><p>Here's my little ship (looks like a boat, for now):</p><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://rosmianto.com/media/posts/3/ship.png" alt="" width="501" height="220" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" srcset="https://rosmianto.com/media/posts/3/responsive/ship-xs.png 300w, https://rosmianto.com/media/posts/3/responsive/ship-sm.png 480w, https://rosmianto.com/media/posts/3/responsive/ship-md.png 768w, https://rosmianto.com/media/posts/3/responsive/ship-xl.png 1200w"></figure><p>Yeah okay, it's a boat, but eventually I want to grow this little boat into a little ship, then a little yacht, and (hopefully) into a cruise ship. Here's what I will do with the ship:</p><p>For Noob Island to Veteran Island, I will help you cross the sea with my ship. Probably you will look like this:</p><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://rosmianto.com/media/posts/3/noob-vet.png" alt="" width="2852" height="1000" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" srcset="https://rosmianto.com/media/posts/3/responsive/noob-vet-xs.png 300w, https://rosmianto.com/media/posts/3/responsive/noob-vet-sm.png 480w, https://rosmianto.com/media/posts/3/responsive/noob-vet-md.png 768w, https://rosmianto.com/media/posts/3/responsive/noob-vet-xl.png 1200w"></figure><p>And for Veteran Island to Noob Island, I will bring resources from Veteran Island, such as their Best Practices, their tools, their network, etc.</p><p>Basically I am a ship captain crossing sea back and forth.</p><p>For now, my little ship is a digital product you can buy right now. It's called Professional Firmware Development Guide, where I show you the workflow I used to build professional-grade firmware for my company and clients.</p><p>If you are interested, you can check it out here: <a href="https://fwguide.rosmianto.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">fwguide.rosmianto.com</a></p><p>Your ship captain is signing out.
